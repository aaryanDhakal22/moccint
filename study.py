        "Why do you want to study in this field?",
        "My interest isn't with computers but with the idea of being able to create anything from nothing. I also appreciate its versatility of this field i.e. the ability to be used anywhere and however we please.",
    ],
    "02": [
        "Is this course related to what you have studied before?",
        "Yes absolutely. I have been studying computer science on my own for the last 6 years and in high school for 2 years",
    ],
    "03": [
        "In what way is it related?",
        "All that Computer Science is, is a unique blend of physics combined with biological concepts and maybe even a bit of math if you choose to go a certain direction so every subject we learned are related; some more and some less",
    ],
    "04": [
        "What were your grades in grades 11 and 12?",
        "In grade 11 I managed to score a 3.29 and in 12 I got 3.64 which helped me get a CGPA of 3.47",

        "What is an F1 VISA?",
        "this is a non-immigrant visa that is usually granted for a period of 5 years",
    ],
    "06": [
        "What will you do if you do not complete the course in the stipulated duration?",
        "I'll try to complete the course as fast as possible and ill try to overcome any challanges that presents itself",
    ],
    "07": [
        "What qualification will you get at the end of your chosen course?",
        "I'll have a bachelor's degree and be called a qualified software engineer but with this college in particular I'll be able to gain On-field research experience and real-world problem-solving skills and be able to pinpoint my strengths and weaknesses moving forwards",
    ],
    "08": [
        "How will this qualification be of use to you?",
        "My goals don't require a degree but they do require the knowledge that a graduate is adept at. To build a website is rather easy even after a simple Bootcamp but the depth of knowledge ill have obtained from this degree will help me make that website,better.",
    ],
    "09": [
        "How will this particular qualification be better for you?",
        "Computer Science is a much broader field than software engineer which is to say there will be more to study more depth, more diversity, more electives and more job opportunities. ",
    ],
    "10": [
        "What did you do in the break that you had during the pandemic?",
        "I tried my best to stay productive and I joined online courses and managed to complete some of the courses that would help me in my college years and even managed to participate and win in the hackathon called the 2021 NASA Space challenge. I also made sure to keep my vocabulary sharp which is why even after the IELTS I continued working on my English skills. Also, there was the research I had to conduct about the universities to which I was going to join. I also got too into learning theory which is why i went on to find a contract to build a software for a school which im still maintaining.",
    ],
    "11": [
        "Do you have any knowledge of this subject field now? How much?",
        "Yes. As I may have mentioned I have been learning computer science for the last 6 years which is why I have a very good picture of the destination that my interest in computers will take me. Since I have been learning online which is why I'd say with my knowledge I probably shouldn't have any trouble up until the third semester because after that, things get a lot spicier",
    ],
    "12": [
        "Will you change to a different course after reaching the U.S.?",
        "No, because this course is very near and dear to my heart and a single look at my GitHub portfolio will make this evident that computer science has and will always be of huge interest to me and will be the only path I go forwards",
    ],
    "13": [
        "Why did you decide to follow this course in the U.S. and not in another English-Speaking country or India?",
        "I dont know about other majors but for computer science USA is known highly for inovation in this industry and having the flexibility to keep moving forward. But besides that, the major reason is that such ever-growing industries force universities to keep up or lay down which is why they have to get better professors and teach newer tech so they can still stay on people's Wishlist. The USA goes as far as even having a city called the Silicon Valley - now that speaks volumes.",
    ],
    "14": [
        "Do you intend to study for another course after you finish the one you are currently enrolling for?",
        "To be honest I haven't thought that through because the computer science industry doesn't always require a master's degree which is why I am not forced to get one and would more likely just return.",
    ],
    "15": [
        "What are your current academic Qualifications?",
        "I graduated from high school in the year 2020 by choosing Math and computer science.",
    ],
    "16": [
        "Are you studying now?",
        "Yes, I am currently studying on many online teaching platforms like Udemy but I'm not admitted to any academic institutions",
